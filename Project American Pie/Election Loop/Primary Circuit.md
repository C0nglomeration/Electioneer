The Primary Circuit is the stage where candidates compete with others within their party for the nomination.

### Primary Polling
At any moment during this phase, candidates can spend a small sum to have polling agencies call around the nation to obtain a benchmark of every candidate's standing in the popular vote. At the beginning, no state is polled. 

### Campaign Advertisement
The main activity during the primary circuit, campaign advertising includes running ads in print, on tv, or online, using money gathered through PACs. PAC money can only be spent on advertising within their niche, in accordance to American law around PACs and how they can spend money. Campaign PACs, however, do not hold this restriction as their money can be spent anywhere in the campaign.

### Rallies and Appearances
After cursory polling and advertisements have been ran, the candidate can choose to make appearances in rallies and town halls in key states to swing voters more directly. However, making appearances comes with the risk of addressing issues among voters. If too many promises are made, the effectiveness of those promises will diminish, and taking extreme stances may alienate more moderate voters from your platform.
