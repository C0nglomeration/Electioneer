Every election has three stages, Candidacy Announcement, Primary Loop, and the Presidential Election itself.

1. [[Candidacy Announcement]]
	1. Character Picker
		1. Name, appearance, and background are decided. Only the background has an influence on the election.
		2. Optionally, premade historical characters appropriate to the election year are available. Incumbent boosts are only applicable to historical characters.
	2. VP Picker
		1. Historically influential politicians, historical VPs, or a custom VP can be selected. The VP pick will have a lesser influence on the election.
	3. Announcement
		1. After the candidate picks are selected, the campaign officially starts with a declaration of key policies and campaign promises.
	4. Fundraising
		1. Through savings, individual donations, or through PACs, money is obtained.
2. [[Primary Circuit]]
	1. Polling (Primary)
		1. Individual states are polled for candidate popularity among voters.
	2. Campaign Advertisement
		1. Funds are spent on billboard/tv ads, or online advertisements. Advertisement efficiency varies from term to term.
	3. Rallies and Appearances
		1. Appearances are made in key states to boost popularity and address issues among voters.
	4. Primary/Caucus Election
		1. State primaries and caucuses are held day-by-day. Other AI candidates with a low share of votes will most likely drop out at this point and have their votes split between the rest.
	5. Nomination
		1. If only one candidate is left after the primaries, the nomination is skipped. Otherwise, votes are tallied and the candidate with the most votes is picked as the presidential candidate.
3. Presidential Election
	1. Polling (Presidential)
		1. Polls are conducted in key states and nationwide to determine the rough popular vote. 
	2. Election Day
		1. Votes are tallied in every state and the president is decided. If you win, you get to move on to the next election as an incumbent or determine a successor within your party.
