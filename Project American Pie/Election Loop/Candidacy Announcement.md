Every game starts in the Candidacy Announcement phase. The candidate, as well as their VP, are decided. The campaign announcement is made, and fundraising begins.

### Character Picker
Here, the candidate's relevant information is decided, as well as their background. By default, the most prominent characters for selection are the main Democratic, Republican, and Independent candidate from that year. Additionally, the other primary candidates for each party can be picked, as well as prominent independents, or even a custom character. 

Candidates who served the previous term already are given an Incumbent bonus due to historical trends. This makes incumbent candidates a good pick for beginners to the game. 

### VP Picker
Next, the Vice President will be picked. Like above, the historical VP pick will be displayed first and most prominently, but only if the historical candidate is picked. Otherwise, influential governors and representatives are provided. A custom VP can also be made.

Vice Presidential candidates provide a key bonus in the state in which they reside, as well as demographic and political bonuses depending on their background.

### Announcement
The campaign is officially announced to the public. Depending on how aligned to the establishment the candidacy is (as well as if the candidacy is endorsed by the incumbent), an appropriate boost to polling numbers is applied.

The player officially picks out their most important policies as well as their campaign promises. Depending on how aligned this is with the voter base, appropriate bonuses are applied to the polling numbers. The candidate can make as many promises as they wish, but the effectiveness of each promise will go down based on how many promises are made. Additionally, the player can only honor a limited number of promises during their term if they win the election. The amount of missed promises will hurt their incumbent and endorsement bonus in the next election.

### Fundraising
Candidates start with a small sum of savings as well as some money from their Campaign PAC. Most of the campaigns funds will come from PACs, with a small trickle of individual donations gaining in strength as more voters are decided. The names of the PACs will be randomly generated from a list each game.
